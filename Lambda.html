  	<div class="item">
  		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">Overview:</b>Alongside three other students, I designed a hypothetical interface for a recent startup called Lambda School. The four of us started off by sketching different interface possibilies, which we used to help visualize our final product. From there, we decided on a concrete design and created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. This prorotype can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/YoIEi4u9P1kyQIK6muaQtBWc/Iterative-Design-and-Evaluation?scaling=contain&node-id=28%3A339" style="color:salmon;" target="_blank">here</a>. We presented our prototype in class, then sent it to a remote​ ​user​ ​testing service to find, and ultimately address, possible usability problems. The goal for this project was to create a blind interface redesign for a startup that interested us, and practice iterating and improving on that interface design. We did our best to stay true to this startup, all while highlighting the aspects that made them unique.</p>

  		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">Sketches:</b> The sketches we creaated were all wildly different in design, but aimed to showcase the interactivity and course-like nature of the startup.</p>

  		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">Hi-fi Mockup:</b> Our mockup of Lambda School focused on expanding on Lambda School’s goal of engaging students who are not able to afford or have the consistent schedule to go to college. We tried to present the authenticity of a college institution while providing the flexible resources needed by remote students. To create our hi-fi prototype, we improved upon our sketches in order to achieve Lambda school’s original goal.</p>

    <div class="item">
  		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">User Testing Hypothesis:</b> Upon viewing the first page, users will be able to identify the function of the website, understand why someone might use it and identify similar services. When they begin to navigate the website, they will be able to correctly identify the function of each screen and of each element on the page. For example, they will not click on elements which are not intended to be interactive and they will not show any signs of surprise at anything they find on the page. They will be able to quickly and easily navigate through the site and to find the way back to any page they have visited before. Users will notice and take interest in the social and interactive features of the website.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
  		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">User Testing Tasks/Questions:</b> 
  			<ul>
  				<li>Without leaving this page, in your own words, describe what do you think you can do on this website? Be specific.</li>
  				<li>In your own words, describe how you might benefit from using this website.</li>
  				<li>Take as much time as you need to explore this website. Move on to the next task when you're ready.</li>
  				<li>Do you know any companies or websites that are similar to this one? If so, explain how this one compares.</li>
  				<li>While exploring the website, did any buttons or features confuse you? If so, what features and where?</li>
  				<li>What frustrated you most about this site?</li>
  				<li>If you had a magic wand, how would you improve this site?</li>
  				<li>What did you like about the site?</li>
  				<li>How likely are you to recommend this site to a friend or colleague (0=Not at all likely, and 10=Very Likely)?</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
  		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">Results:</b> Our hypothesis was correct in several respects. Our testers were all immediately able to identify the purpose of the website, and all of them said that it would be useful, some even suggesting that they would like to use it when it was completed. All of them were able to name similar services. All mentioned the video chat or discussion features of the website and suggested that these made the website better.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
  		<p>On several other points, our hypothesis was only partially correct or correct only for some users. All users but one were confused by the purpose of the “conference” page, but all were able to identify the functions of every other page. All users were able to find their way to every page in the interface, but one user navigated only through the arrow buttons on the figma prototype and not through interface elements. Others occasionally used these arrows in addition to the interface elements. It is not clear whether this indicates difficulty understanding the navigation of the website, but it fails to demonstrate our hypothesis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
  		<p>In general, our users suggested that the website was well thought-out, but none were particularly impressed by the design. There were several suggestions to make the interface more exciting and “colorful”. Users mentioned that the bland design made the website appear academic and formal, which they suggested could be beneficial to a brand trying to establish its legitimacy, but they also thought that this made it less pleasant to use.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
  		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">Interface Changes:</b> Based on the feedback we received from testers, there are a couple design changes that we believe would benefit our interface. Primarily, we believe that the content and naming of the “Conference” page could greatly be improved for clarity. This page of our interface was the primary source of confusion for our testers, with many not understanding what the name implied, nor knowing what the “Conference” page’s purpose was. With this in mind, a clearer menu name and a more developed “Conference” page, perhaps with help buttons or additional text to describe features to the user, would be beneficial to our interface’s usability. Pictures of a student and instructor mock “conference calling” - as opposed to the blank screens currently depicted - would also be a good change to both this page and our interface as a whole.</p>
    </div>

      <div class="item" style="justify-content:center; margin-bottom:15px;"><center><img src="images/hifi/conference.PNG"><br></div>
      <div class="item" style="color: #515151; font-weight: bold; justify-content:center; margin-bottom:25px;">The "Conference" Page</div></center>

    <div class="item">
  		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">User Testing Reflections:</b> The usability tests done through UserTesting were an interesting way to get feedback on our interface from a wide variety of people. It’s difficult getting feedback from people from significantly different backgrounds and demographics when one is living in a university bubble. In that sense, UserTesting is a very convenient and efficient method of testing a wide (or very specific) audience. Furthermore, the fact that all tests are recorded and easily structured for review made the entire experience streamlined and successful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
  		<p>However, it’s worth noting that this sort of testing might be significantly more beneficial to an interface more developed than our current model. All the testers, at one point or another, used the arrow keys to flip through pages in our interface - rather than the interactive elements on the interface itself - which was something we did not expect. This made it difficult to gauge usability levels and whether or not users had difficulty navigating our site. Perhaps this could have been solved with a different prototyping application, or perhaps our site just needs a bit more work. Either way, a more developed interface would surely have allowed for more intimate use during testing, and ultimately have allowed more in-depth questions and tasks for our testers.</p>

    <div class="item">
  		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">Conclusion:</b> Working in a group always has its pros and cons. Ultimately, I believe this project was a great introduction to the intereative process of creating a website, but our execution left a lot to be desired. Had we more time I think this project could have been much more developed. However, given our time constraints and lack of experience using the tools provided, we did what we could and I still learned a lot about the creative process involved in web design. In the end, we contacted Lambda School to show them the work we did for this project, in hopes that it might give them a unique perspective to the challenges their startup currently faces.</p>
