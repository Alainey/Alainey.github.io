		<p>The code for this project can be found on my github <a href="https://github.com/Alainey/Betrayal-0320" style="color:salmon;" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>

  	<div class="item">
		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">Overview:</b> This project is an online version of the popular multiplayer tabletop game: Betrayal at House on the Hill. The goal of this application was to create an interactive version of Betrayal at House on the Hill that would allow users to play with eachother from the comfort of their own home. At the time of this application's creation, there were no alternative solutions for individuals to play Betrayal at House on the Hill unless those individuals were in the same room (with a hard copy of the game). This made playing the game difficult for a group of friends who live accross the country from each other, and, with that in mind, my friends and I took it upon ourselves to develop our own digital version of the game.</p>

  	<div class="item">
		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">My Role in Development:</b> I wrote a majority of the code for the front end side of this application, primarily dealing with menu updates and information display. Alongside desinging the front-end interface, I also helped to integrate the back-end code with my own in order to provide seamless gameplay.</p>
  	</div>

  	<div class="item">
		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">Design Challenges and Decisions:</b> Time was one of our biggest constraints. In the README provided with our project <a href="https://github.com/Alainey/Betrayal-0320" style="color:salmon;" target="_blank"> here on Github</a>, we provide a general description for the gameplay of Betrayal at House on the Hill. The game is split up into two parts: the pre-Haunt and post-Haunt phases. The pre-Haunt half of the game allows players to explore the house, generating a game board randomly based on the tiles they uncover. The items found in the pre-Haunt phase determine the eventual rules of the post-Haunt phase, and huge fluctuation in gameplay rules made Betrayal at Hosue on the Hill a difficult game to design an application for. We underestimated how long it would take us to build only the first half of the game, and eventually had to wrap up our project before we crossed our project's deadline.</p>

  	<div class="item">
		<p><b style="color: #515151; font-size: 18px;">Conclusion:</b> In the end, we were never able to fully implement the game, instead opting to focus on making the first half of the game (pre-Haunt) fully functional. We had hoped to support at least one version of post-Haunt gameplay, but decided our efforts were better spent on polishing functionality in the first half of the game. </p>
